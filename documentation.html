    <h3>Design Process</h3>
    <p> The design of my visualization was fairly simple.  Unfortunately, the time it took to learn and implement
        D3 took away from the time I was able to invest in the creativity of the visualization.  My process started
        with the basics of having an SVG on the page that represented Dr. John Snow’s cholera map.  From there I
        decided I wanted to visualize the genders by color and the age groups by symbols.  After getting the map
        recreated, I added the line graph that showed the deaths per day.  I made the decision to align the line
        graph to the right of the map so that it would be easy to see the day filter applied to the map.  I then
        decided to simply use bar charts to visualize the age and gender data.  Once again, I would have preferred
        to spend more time to make the visualization a little more intricate, but the ramp up speed for learning D3
        as well as the tediousness nature of manually creating SVGs using D3 took away from being more creative with
        the visualization.   After getting the charts created, I thought that it would be interesting to add an age and
        gender filter.  The filters are applied to all visualizations (except the deaths/day line graph) and will work
        with the day filter as well.  In retrospect, it would have been nice to have the age and gender filters work on
        the timeline graph, but the limited development time prevented the ability to add that feature.  Lastly, the map
        legend was created to give the user a resource to understand the meaning of the markings on the map, and the
        zoom/pan functionality was implemented to allow a better view of what was happening around the map.</p>
    <h3>Rationale</h3>
    <p>
        My visualization is not flashy.  I intentionally did not want to overcomplicate the data by adding too much
        color or overloaded information.  However, there are a few things worth noting in my rationale.  First, and
        probably most interesting, is the way I encoded the age and gender data on the map.  As explained in the design
        process, I encoded the gender data with colors (shades of blue and pink) and the ages with symbols.  I chose
        colors for gender since male and female already have the colors associated with them (infants wear blue if male
        and pink if female).  The symbols were designated in order to more quickly see metadata about the deaths on the
        map.  Admittedly, the symbols are difficult to decipher if the map isn’t filtered, but it is still more telling
        than using a circle.  Another other major design choice was the alignment of the charts.  I spent so much time
        learning and implement functionality that creativity took a back seat to functionality.  That is why the
        visualization is quite blocky and boring.  The choice to put the legend and filters at the top of the page was
        so that it is obvious that filtering is a functionality of the visualization.  The last rationale worth explaining
        is why I put the ’about’ page in the navbar.  This decision was made because of the limited space for the
        visualization, and the professor’s desire to have all of the graphs in view without scrolling.  Nonetheless,
        I preferred the lack of clutter that words would have put in the visualization, and I think it makes the site
        feel more robust.

    <h3>Discoveries by Visualization</h3>
    As I have alluded to many times, almost the entirety of my time was spent developing because of the scope of the
    project requirements was so vast.  The being said, I did appreciate the how the metadata distinguished deaths.
    In the first included screen shot you can see how the timeline give an idea of the lifecycle of the disease.
    <img src="death_peak.png" style="max-width:100%; max-height:100%;">
    Another interesting observation was the higher deaths in the first and last age brackets.  This intuitively
    makes sense considering these ages typically have weaker immune systems and succumb to disease before other age groups.
    <img src="age_graph.png" style="max-width:100%; max-height:100%;">
    Of course, these observations are aside from the original conclusion that John Snow had, that there is a correlation of deaths to the center pump.  That correlation is just as obvious in my visualization, if not more so.
